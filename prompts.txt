Write ansible notebook to host multiple application on the VPN server
As a start you need to setup the code for 2 applications
First Application would the wordpress setup, name it app-gudliving and create respective files and folder in it like defaults to strore the default variables required and roles to define the roles for the ansible code
Second application is the React.js and Python FastAPI pushed at https://github.com/pardeepgoel83/my_ledger_app having two folders like server and web which would be deployed using the Dockerfile saved in those directories, name it app-ledger and create respective files and folder in it like defaults to strore the default variables required and roles to define the roles for the ansible code


Write an Ansible playbook (notebook style) to host multiple applications on a VPN server.

Requirements:
1. Set up code for two applications:
   - **app-gudliving**: A WordPress setup. Create a directory structure for this application, including:
     - `defaults/` to store default variables
     - `roles/` to define Ansible roles for installation and configuration
   - **app-ledger**: A React.js and Python FastAPI application from [https://github.com/pardeepgoel83/my_ledger_app](https://github.com/pardeepgoel83/my_ledger_app), which contains `server` (FastAPI) and `web` (React.js) folders, each with its own Dockerfile. Create a directory structure for this application, including:
     - `defaults/` to store default variables
     - `roles/` to define Ansible roles for Docker-based deployment of both `server` and `web`

Ensure the playbook is modular, reusable, and follows best practices for Ansible directory structure.
